These poems present differing visions of the Ariel poems from earlier drafts. Recordings are from end of October 1962. 
Audio recordings emphasize the deeply sonic quality of Plath's later poems (assonance, rhyme, alliteration, polyphony, foreign languages). 

Next steps:
Transcribe audio versions.
Conceptualize and design visualizations for dual audio-textual poems representations. 
Consult with MVP folks about program that would allow stream of audio alongside presentation of text versions.

Met with Christine from the library to discuss potential Plath collaborations, past projects that made use of the Plath visual materials, how to work with Plath's estate (likely difficult)

Met with Katie T about z-axis work. Brainstormed potential novels and workflow ideas.
