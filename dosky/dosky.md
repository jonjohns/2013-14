### Exploring "Teaching and Learning Multimodal Communications"

* Finding Scalar really easy to navigate without much rehearsal. It's easy to figure out how to return to the home page for a particular pathway, and also to the "Welcome" page.
*  How many steps is too many steps on a path? 

*  I really like the annotations that accompany Emily Smith's [FlowMotion](http://scalar.usc.edu/maker/english-507/smith-workflow-page1?path=workflow) workflow screencast. For some reason that make the inclusion of the video seem more of a deliberate part of the book rather than a source that was added on the fly. The other projects, whose annotations appear as part of the video without any text on the surrounding page force the reader to watch the video and I can't just skim a project, and they seem to be stuck in their original contexts, as opposed to being integrated into their new one.

*  I don't like nested paths on Scalar, mostly because they usually lead to disappointment. In the projects I've been browsing, nested paths are not often well-developed. I want more information!!! The disappointment I feel when I pursue a poorly developed path is equivalent to the frustration I feel when I encounter a "stub" on Wikipedia. I want the information on a 'path' to be limitless, and if it can't be that, then it should at least cover the basics...plus a little more. Example: the "Archives" Path on [DNA: Seven Interactive Essays on Diginal Nonlinear Storytelling](http://dnaanthology.com/anvc/dna/archives) 

### After the Document Model for Scholarly Communicaiton: Some Considerations for Authoring with Rich Media (Craig Dietrich)

"humanities practitioners currently need platforms to help them: (1) facilitate the aggregation of web-based content, (2) responsibly embed and share that content, (3) interpret the content in a flexible and open way, (4) identify and create relationships between the content, and (5) express those relationships through a variety of formats, genres, views, and arrangements"

*  Associations that threaten credibility - monograph appearing in digital spaces and contexts that do not align with views perpetuated in scholarly article/monograph (incompatibility is cool--that's what scholarship is all about, but misrepresenting ideas and placing those skewed ideas in new contexts as correlatives and making them accessible to the masses is not!), and perhaps to one's detriment, there is the risk that one's work (i.e. your work) might appear as though it operaties in partnership with  a another person's work, even though such a relationship might not be sanctioned. Do you worry about your URL being embedded in places or referenced in association with other people/organizations you don't want it to be linked to? 

### Some issues with Scalar

*  While Scalar supports a vast breadth of media formats, video for example, is not actually part of the digital book; Scalar simply references the unique resource identifies of the media that the creator adds. They are quick to mention, though, that using sources like the Internet Archive will ensure that media links are preserved long term. What is long term, though? How long can we expect URIs from the internet archive to remain maintained? If there's something on YouTube that the creator wants to use in his or her book, can she/he simply add it to Critical Commons? Is it really that simple? --I'm thinking of Chun here.. 

*  I like ThoughMesh's feature that displays not only sections of text with similar tags, but also related materials from across the internet (so long as the results remain separate). Can Scalar do this?

*  Serialization of text will mimic our own learning in many ways - number of connections and links via tagging, commentary, linking etc will increase over time, across chapters etc., the text will be plastic. This will even be enhanced: open source will allow people to repurpose, reappropriate and reimagine the text in new ways (even if they're don't reflect the original text they reflect various learning processes) - tagging also important from a pedagogical perpective--helps readers to put ideas in both their specific and broader contexts via tagging

*  Will people still invest in a print version of a scholarly monograph if there is an open-access, open-source version online? This means it is widely available and easily modified. WHY invest in a print version? --Look into this!

"Context-sensitive design" "A Scalar "view" becomes a design feature joining book and critic." - how do authors writing on your work speak to one another? Can they speak directly to one another is they're talking about different iterations of your text that incorporate varying degrees and combinations of changes to both content and form? Versioning projects focussing on born digital materials are going to be dizzying..
