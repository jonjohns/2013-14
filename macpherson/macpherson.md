## Log #1: First steps on the Kits project

Since this is my first proper (non-exorcism-based) log entry, I'm going to experiment a bit with Markdown, so if you're reading this, please excuse the stylistic mess.

Today @KatieMcQ, @zaqir, and I met with @ninab so she could bring us into the loop on the work she did over the summer for the wearables kit concept. We hashed out our preliminary steps and decided that, to begin, the best course of action would be to collectively agree on what exactly the first kit should contain. The concept of wearable electronic (or electrical) jewellery/clothing/accessories extends back as far as the 19th century, so it obviously has a rich and varied history. Today we discussed both overall potential approaches to designing the kits (for example, genealogical versus archaeological kit series; a focus on with a series of kits should tell a story or if each kit should be a complete cultural narrative). We agreed that the best way to approach the project is to consider what the cultural impact of a given technology was/is, and design the kits in such a way that subsequent kits in the series would elaborate or expand on the concepts explored in earlier ones. With this approach in mind, I think we are all leaning towards starting in the nineteenth century and the work of Trouv√©, with an idea that at some point a kit would address the flash jewellery of the 60s and possibly the integration of digital technologies into wearable media in the 90s and beyond. We hope to settle on an approach soon so that we can move onto the R&D phase.
