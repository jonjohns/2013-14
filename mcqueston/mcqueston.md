I'm considering the differences between designing the package to resemble a jewelry box vs "fresh off the shelf" packaging. It would ultimately mean the difference between purchasing or desiring and owning an object and could also extend to a utopic vs intimate experience.
Jewelry boxes also come with greater accessability in terms of reference images, therefore we could borrow from popular late 1800's french filigree, velvet/silk cusions, inlay, tiffany or pyrography with more freedom of design and better historical accuracy. I could also design secondary packaging for the jewelry pieces.

*  It might be interesting to note whether or not wearable electronics were in use before they entered the cultural sphere. For example head lamps used for industrial applications such as mining.

*  When objects enter the cultural sphere, there is an imagined world in which these things exist in (Design proverb: To design an object is to imagine a world where that object would exist). 
What did the "ideal world" look like to the participants of the electronic wearables fad: Glamorous? heavenly? Precious/Twee (like mood rings)? Fantastical like the--often sparkling--women of Art Deco posters at the time? or Futuristic etc...?
I think this is something we should try to grasp in our research and then communicate this accordingly through materials and design.

*  It is also interesting to compare the multiple identities one object or mechanism may possess as well as the crossovers that exist between being a "cultural object" and supposed "non-cultural" objects of the industrial world.
