# Workflow (Working Draft) (Authors: Ad√®le Barclay, Alex Christie, and Katie Tanigawa)

* select texts and editions (1) 
* select appropriate map with consideration to time, detail of map and location (2) (3)
* the map will preferably be one that is appropriate for selected texts
* scan map (stitch images together if necessary or see if the library is able to use their big scanner to scan the map[s])
* upload map to [MudBox](http://www.autodesk.com/products/mudbox/overview)
* markup text with georeferenced coordinates using TEI tag: [geo](http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ref-geo.html) (8)  
* decide where a portion of the text is located (4) (5) (6)
* mark where word count in the location begins and ends
* use XSLT (?) to aggregate word count and location information
* establish ratio for modeling
* take georeferenced word count and divide location-based word count by the total word count of the novel (is there a way to automate this?) (7)
* decide where the center of the mounds will be and how to establish the width of the mound using a rationale that can be applied to multiple novels
* distort the map
* click on the location the text occurs the number of times as established using the ratio (is there a way to automate this?)
* compare maps of both novels! 

(1) Do we need a criteria to establish which editions we use? (If so, what is this criteria?)

(2) Do we need a criteria to establish which maps? (If so, what is this criteria?)

(3) Do we need to choose texts that would share the same map/use similar maps?

(4) What do we do with imagined spaces, remembered spaces and spaces referenced outside of the city we are georeferencing?

(5) How do we represent portions of text where the characters are in transit? 

(6) How do we represent portions of texts that cannot be geolocated with even a loose kind of precision? 

(7) What can we automate?

(8) How do we georeference things appropriately using XML? Is this a question to ask Zaqir, Martin, etc?
