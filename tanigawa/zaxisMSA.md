# The Z-Axis: Where Modernist Studies and Digital Humanities Meet  

As an English literature
graduate student, I have been fortunate enough to work with the
Modernist Versions Project (MVP) and alongside the Maker Lab at the
University of Victoria. Both the MVP and the Lab are influenced by, if
not committed to interdisciplinary research methods that bring together
more traditional literary analysis methods and emerging digital
humanities methods. In the process, both the MVP and Lab promote
collaboration and thinking beyond and between disciplines, in order to
allow for new modes of inquiry into modernist literature, media, and
cultural studies. 

And so I’d like to talk about one of the new modes of inquiry being explored by the MVP that arose because of
this commitment to interdisciplinarity: Z-Axis research. 

What I’ll do is first explain what Z-Axis research is, then talk about the past, present
and immediate future of the this very interdisciplinary project. 

Dr. Jentery Sayers, head of the Maker Lab,
writes that “…the Z-Axis initiative underscores the relevance of
subjective encounters with data, with an emphasis on 3D modeling,
prototyping, and desktop fabrication techniques.”  And Dr. Stephen Ross,
head of the MVP, describes this research as a combination of “literary
analysis and desktop fabrication that allows us to ask how might our
data be expressed, experienced, embodied, and felt.” 

Ultimately it’s an interdisciplinary, critical approach to modernist
literature that brings together traditional literary analysis (close
reading, theory, etc.)  with mapping techniques, and digital humanities
methods that include 3D modeling and print fabrication in order to make
a critical argument about the relationships between text, space, time, and in
one instantiation, the reader’s experiences of a city in a given text. Moreover, it uses a kind of modernist aesthetics of remediation,
distortion, and fragmentation of time and space in order to critique
the relationship between modernists texts and their cities.

I think the best way of explaining what Z-Axis
research can be, is to show you the first instantiation of Z-Axis
research conducted through the MVP and Maker Lab. 

![A deformed map of Dublin](/datamound.png "Data Mounds")

What you see above is a 1925 map of Dublin that has been scanned and deformed using a 3D
modeling software in order to consider a reader’s geotemporal experience
of  Dublin through Joyce’s Ulysses. These mounds represent the
reader’s geotemporal experience of the novel by mapping the word count
in Joyce’s Ulysses locatable in a region of Dublin. 

![Data model for Ulysses Dublin](/datamodelimage.png "Data Model for Ulysses")

Above, you can see our [data model](/ulyssesdatamodel.xlsx "Data Model for Ulysses") for the word count per location. We did
our best to figure out where events were in the text and then did a word
count to see how many words were spent in the area. And from there we
divide that by the total number of words in the book to get the ratio.
So for example roughly 30262 words or roughly 13% of the words in the
novel are “spent” at 7 Eccles Street.

My colleague Alex Christie took that ratio (roughly
.13), and, using the 3D modeling software Mudbox, raised the area on the
map accordingly in order create the mound we see on the map at the very
bottom. Three things became clear early on. First, the reader gets a very limited view of Dublin; Second, the reader is
disproportionately located in just a handful of areas; and third, the
reader’s temporal experience of Dublin is quite different from the
temporal experience of space by the characters. 

After we came up with this 3D model that embodied our inquiry and argument for
the modernist aesthetic of distortion of time and space in Ulysses, Alex
took the model one step further and created what he termed data
tornadoes.   

![Data Tornadoes](/datatorando.png "Data Tornadoes")

These tornadoes are high resolution images of the map we
looked at earlier, and because it is a high resolution image, it shows
the grooves of the streets and fragments the mounds accordingly. So
where the mounds reveal a deformation of a map by the text, the
tornadoes not only deform but actually embody a
modernist and cubist aesthetic that fragments the maps using our data sets. Moreover, the cityscape itself, through the
grooves the streets make in the landscape, distort and fragment the data
mounds. 

So that’s where the Z-Axis research was. The Z-Axis
research undertaken by the MVP and Maker Lab will focuses on geospatial
versioning, or comparing of modernist cities as represented by modernist
novels in order to show how cities, such as Dublin and London, morph
from text to text. So a question we could explore through these models
might be how do The Secret Agent, Mrs. Dalloway, and The Heat of the Day
construct London differently? One of the reasons to create and compare
such models is that these models embody the argument that cities
themselves become malleable and transform. These models will hopefully
show that cities are not static or purely objective entities, but are
written, and read, and interpreted. And by embodying and then comparing
these versions of cities, we can see and even feel the way literary
modernisms were not simply influenced by these major cities, but helped
to create these cityscapes as well.
