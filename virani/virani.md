# Zaqir's Maker Lab Log (2013-14)

## Monday, 9 September 2013

Met with Shaun, Nina, and Katie M. to discuss moving forward with the Flash Jewelry Kit. The following questions were raised:
-  Do we want the kit to modernize our content?
-  which mechanism will be emphasized?
-  Do we treat the cultural moment as a singularity, or evoke the context and maturation of the mechanism?
